## Introduction

Designed with multi-screen viewing in mind, this is a variation of the project set forth by Turing School of Software and Design. [See rubric here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html).

Users can interact with a selection movies uploaded from a RESTful API by scrolling through images and titles of said movies. They then can click a movie to view further details and either use the back button or the provided home button to navigate to the landing page.

As a team, we decided to polish off our work to create an MVP that meets [Iteration 4](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html) requirements. We decided to deploy this site to gh pages as our stretch and reaffirm our knowledge in React, Router, & Cypress-- the three new technologies we learned and utilized in this project.

## Future Iterations

More specifics about future work or refactoring can be found in this projects [GH issues](https://github.com/gaj23/rancid/issues).

Discussion about applying SCSS principals occurred at the beginning of our project. However, rather than get ahead of ourselves, we reoriented ourselves to keep the MVP in mind. A future iteration could include SCSS refactoring.
